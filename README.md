# ClockGUV-Model

-- MATLAB CODE (Version 2021a or greater) -- 
(tested with version 2021a)

Models the behavior of the circadian clock of the cyanobacteria, Synechococcus elongatus, inside a giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV). The model is based on varied encapsulated concentration of the post-translational oscillator (Kai clock proteins) inside GUVs.
There are two versions of this model, one simulating the environment within a GUV used in our experiments and one simulating the behavior of a transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL) system.
